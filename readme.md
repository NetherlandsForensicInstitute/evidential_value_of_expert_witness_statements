
This repository provides code to compute LRs from forensic expert statements on prepared 
same-source and different-source samples.

Data are taken from the literature sources listed below.
When these were given in non-downloadable form the numbers have been manually copied.
Otherwise, urls of files are provided in the scripts - these should be included in a 'data' folder
for the scripts to run. If your current setup allows the code will download the files 
for you, otherwise you will have to manually provide them.
